# WpWebFramework
An early aborted proof of concept of an MVC web development framework for building Wordpress based apps. Implements hook routing, view template rendering, i18n, resource management, and configuration support. 

The framework is placed under the folder WpWebFramework in the root of this repository.

The repository itself represents a Wordpress plugin that emulates a very simple sample app making use of this framework.
